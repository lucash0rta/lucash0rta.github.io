        <h1>Interactive Experience Research Project </h1>

        <h2>LIQUID ENTROPY | MIKA CHERNOV & SINJIN HAWKE</h2>


        <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

        <p>The flow of visuals that begin from my mouse.  </p>

        <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Moving the mouse around the screen and experimenting with the art</li>
            <li>Adjusting the parameters that are visible in the corner and seeing how they interact</li>
            <li>After changing the paramaters being able to reset to the original view</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

        <p>Adjusting the paramaters and seeing how they interfere with the visuals created.</p>

        <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

        <p>Moving the mouse around the screen</p>

        <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

        <p>My impression of the primary goal of this experience is to interact with 
            the art that is the code the person has created for people to interact with the site. 
            The purpose is solely to view the piece as a generative experience 

        </p>

        <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

        <p>The interactive experience is a direct image of the goal of the site. It is the goal and the site together</p>

        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

        <p>The interactive experience can be used for a short amount of time. The parameters and their interactions with each other are very interesting to play with although if the site was wanting to be engaging for a longer time some more parameters or adjustment layers would make it more interesting </p>

        <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

        <p>The experience is meant to be used over time and explored through the use of paramaters</p>

        <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

        <p>Photography with using the image of the warehouse </p>

        <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

        <p>That it is an abandoned space open to explore and interact with</p>

        <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

        <p>To feel alone in the space, to look around, to explore. The use of the liminal empty warehouse is a perfect setting. 
            You can almost feel the wet concrete beneath your feet. </p>
        <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

        <p>The limits and freedoms within the parameters</p>

        <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

        <p>Being free to explore in this harsh space and seeing the flows and creases the artist has painted with code for users to splash around in </p>
