    <h1>Progress Documentation</h1>
    <p>here is my some additional documentation for my project to give additional support to the commenting in my HTML, CSS and JAVA. 
         <br>
         My initial process for deciding what sort of interaction I was after was to look for inspiration for <br> from other media players and on pinterest to discover what aesthetic I would like my <br>design to be. 
<br><br>
Below is my initial moodboard where i drew inspiration for my final design <br><br>

<br>For the key feature i drew main inspiration from spotify and soundcloud, below is a screenshot of the spotify user interface. <br><br>

Initially when creating my new feature. Which is being able to read the current playback time of the media player I had in mind that on the other side the number would simply be a static of the total duration of the song. After looking to these different popular streaming platforms I noticed that the most common  design choice is to have featured the time remaining of the track. Therefor I decided to change my code <br><br>

I have added notes in my javascript on the math used to be able to convert the currentLengthOnlySec into minutes and seconds in the format MM:SS <br><br>



Changing the progress bar<br>

I decided to use java to take the total length and the current playback time and convert it into a percentage. I then used this percentage to move the new div I had created along the width of the parent div which in turn aligned with the progress bar underneath. Then I set the pointerEvents to null so that the user can still access the underlying interactable prog bar that was included in the code. I then set the underlying background image to my custom dial I created in photoshop. <br><br>

Below I will put all my separated elements I have used and made for my site. 
<br>
Aswell as additional screenshots from my progress.
